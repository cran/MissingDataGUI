\usage{
data(tao)
}
\description{
Real-time data from moored ocean buoys for improved detection,
understanding and prediction of El Ni'o and La Ni'a.
}
\details{
The data is collected by the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean project (
\url{http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/index.shtml}).

Format: a data frame with 736 observations on the following 8
variables. \describe{\item{\code{year}}{A factor with levels
\code{1993} \code{1997}.} \item{\code{latitude}}{A factor with
levels \code{-5}  \code{-2} \code{0}.} \item{\code{longitude}}{A
factor with levels \code{-110} \code{-95}.}
\item{\code{sea.surface.temp}}{Sea surface temperature(degree
Celsius), measured by the TAO buoys at one meter below the
surface.}  \item{\code{air.temp}}{Air temperature(degree Celsius),
measured by the TAO buoys three meters above the sea surface.}
\item{\code{humidity}}{Relative humidity(%), measured by the TAO
buoys 3 meters above the sea surface.} \item{\code{uwind}}{The
East-West wind vector components(M/s).  TAO buoys measure the wind
speed and direction four meters above the sea surface. If it is
positive, the East-West component of the wind is blowing towards
the East. If it is negative, this component is blowing towards the
West.}\item{\code{vwind}}{The North-South wind vector
components(M/s). TAO buoys measure the wind speed and direction
four meters above the sea surface. If it is positive, the
North-South component of the wind is blowing towards the North.
If it is negative, this component is blowing towards the South.}}
